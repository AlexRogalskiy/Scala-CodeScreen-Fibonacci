# Scala-CodeScreen-Fibonacci

Example CodeScreen Scala assessment that requires the candidate to write a method that returns the nth element in the Fibonacci sequence.

The class to write this method in is [src/main/scala/dev/codescreen/FibonacciCalculator.scala](src/main/scala/dev/codescreen/FibonacciCalculator.scala).

The test cases that are run and are visible to the candidate are located in [src/test/scala/dev/codescreen/FibonacciCalculatorTest.scala](src/test/scala/dev/codescreen/FibonacciCalculatorTest.scala).

The test cases that are run and are hidden to the candidate are located in [src/test/scala/dev/codescreen/FibonacciCalculatorHiddenTest.scala](src/test/scala/dev/codescreen/FibonacciCalculatorHiddenTest.scala).
